# D00M

D00M Game is a text-based game implemented in Python, inspired by the classic DOOM game. It provides a simplified version of DOOM's gameplay in a terminal environment.

## Gameplay

In D00M Game, you control a player character represented by the letter "P". Your goal is to navigate through a maze, find the exit ("X"), and avoid being caught by the enemy ("E")

Use the "W/A/S/D" keys to move the player character in the up, left, down, and right directions, respectively. Press the space bar to shoot projectiles at the enemy. The game ends when you reach the exit, or if you collide with the enemy.

## Prerequisites

To run D00M Game, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the following command to start the game:

- Use the "W/A/S/D" keys to move the player character. Press the space bar to shoot projectiles. Press "Q" to quit the game.

## Limitations
